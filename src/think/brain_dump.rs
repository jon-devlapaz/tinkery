//! Think's screen: the writing box, the original, the reading and its one question, review and
//! the receipt, wired to the conversation, the model and ledger.
//!
//! The rules live in the parts: [`Conversation`] decides what is asked and sent, `reading` and
//! `review` own the model's contracts, [`board`] verifies a reply, and `seed_me` saves. This
//! file routes input to them and paints the result. Nothing is sent without F2, and nothing is
//! saved without a typed `confirm`.
