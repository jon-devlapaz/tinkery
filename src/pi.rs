//! The one place Tinkery starts a model host, Pi or Claude Code: a bounded, cancellable process
//! per request, and the call budget every request is counted against.
//!
//! A request runs its host with no saved session, extensions, plugins, MCP servers, skills or context
//! files, so the model sees only the prompt, the input and, when a caller asks for them, read-only
//! tools (Pi's `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`; Claude Code's `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`): it can read
//! files inside the folder the host starts in, never outside it, and runs no commands. Without
//! tools, Claude Code starts in an empty folder. Claude Code gets a clean environment, so a
//! parent session's settings never leak in, and Tinkery reads no credentials of either host.
//! Input is capped at 128 KiB and replies at 32 KiB. Every completed or cancelled request stops its process
//! group and reaps the direct child; descendants that leave that group are outside this
//! ownership. Nothing retries on its own.
//! Each request reports how many model responses it used when the host says so (Pi's throwaway
//! session file, deleted when the request ends; Claude Code's `num_turns`); otherwise unknown.
//! Callers get text back, or one line saying why not. Which phase asks is the caller's business; this module names none.
