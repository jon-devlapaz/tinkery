//! Shape's agent step: one operator key, then (when it says so) one model call through the chosen
//! harness with read-only tools, and the shared ledger calls that record the result.
//!
//! The model only investigates and drafts words: what it found, with the next question or what the
//! seed confirms, plus separate check records validated only by Tinkery's ledger. It never formats or runs checks. It reads only the folder the operator was shown. Tinkery saves the operator's
//! answer, the question and the findings, builds the seed's evidence and decisions from
//! the ledger, and confirms a seed itself, each through the shared session boundary. The model is never asked to confirm
//! anything, and nothing it replies can confirm a seed. Each step counts against the call budget
//! before the model starts; with none left it refuses before writing anything.
