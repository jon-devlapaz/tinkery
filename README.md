# Tinkery

## The big idea

Tinkery is a calm substrate where a messy thought becomes useful, checked agent work,
without losing your words or your control. Nothing runs without you: one next step, with a way out.

## The journey

**Think → Tend → Shape → Approve → work happens → Watch → Taste → Measure**

| Place | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Think** | Clarify what you want: one reading, one question at a time. |
| **Tend** | Choose a saved goal and open its detail. |
| **Shape** | Investigate and turn the goal into a confirmed seed. |
| **Approve** | Understand the decision and exactly what you're authorizing. |
| **Watch** | See progress, blockers and decisions needing your attention. |
| **Taste** | Compare the result with your original goal; accept or correct it. |
| **Measure** | Judge accepted, checked results against your effort. |

This is the intended journey, not all shipped behavior. Originals remain verbatim;
confirmed goals stay unchanged through handoffs. Readings and suggestions are guesses.

## What Tinkery builds on

- **SDLC** organizes external implementation, checks and review.
- **GitHub** holds issues, PRs, checks and reviews.
- **You** authorize work and judge results.

Tinkery connects those records; it doesn't invent a competing set of approvals.

Goal confirmation, brief confirmation and implementation approval are separate.
Copying a prompt authorizes none of them and starts no agent. Voice is local dictation.

## What works today

- **Think:** clarify a dump and explicitly save the confirmed goal, unchanged, to
  `~/.local/share/tinkery/sessions/` with a record in `~/.local/share/tinkery/think/`.
  Questions offer a suggested answer when available: F1 can copy it for editing; F2 sends.
  When started in Git, the menu names the repository and the record keeps its origin.
- **Tend:** active goals form a needs graph. Link or unlink goals, open detail, or copy
  Shape without changing saved sessions.
  Press `r` in detail for [Think history](docs/design/shape-and-handoff.md#think-history)
  when its saved record verifies.
- **Shape:** press `s` in goal detail or choose menu place 3 to see the current question,
  waiting draft or verified ready seed. With real drafting set up
  ([terminal setup](docs/terminal-setup.md#launch)), `--shape-budget CALLS` (default zero)
  sets the launch allowance shared by Think and Shape. `F2` saves an answer and lets an agent investigate the next with
  read-only tools, and confirms the seed in your words once you've read it to the end.
  Agents operate Think and Shape with `--operator agent`; their saves are
  [recorded as the agent's](docs/design/think.md#confirmation-attribution-185). `F1` lists
  every other action allowed now by number: So far (the whole goal and decisions), objecting
  to an assumed default, optional one-call teach-back on a draft (mismatches never block
  confirming), the options on a hard-to-undo question after your instinct, and ending a
  session, which asks once more. Tinkery owns the ledger, seed checks,
  confirmation, verification and ending; no viewer or network read is involved.
  `tinkery seed status --json DIR` and `tinkery seed checks DIR` expose read-only intake JSON.
  Its draft guidance and artifact reference are bundled; no external skill is needed.
  Intake commands use `--tinkery PATH` to recheck the seed through this executable.
- **Approve:** menu place 4 shows verified seeds, oldest first, with their exact goal
  and acceptance checks. `c` copies run creation and intake commands; nothing runs.
  Seeds already started move to Watch; without a named checkout, start status is unknown.
  See [Approve](docs/design/approve.md).
- **Watch:** with `--sdlc-root PATH`, reads that tink-sdlc checkout's runs through its own
  `status --json` when opened or on `r`, runs waiting on you first. Matched runs show their
  exact saved goal; changed or missing originals stay unknown. It runs only read-only
  status commands and changes no records.
- **Taste:** menu place 6 uses `--sdlc-root PATH` and repeatable launch-only
  `--taste-result RUN_ID=PR_URL` inputs (canonical run UUIDv4, full GitHub PR URL).
  `r` explicitly reads runs and those PRs; handoff prose supplies no links.
  Review the unchanged goal, exact commit, matching
  check states and plain owed gates. `o` opens the PR; `a`/`c` copy external review
  handoffs, recording no verdict and merging nothing. After accepting externally,
  `l` reports that decision for this snapshot and reveals one italic next-dump guess;
  `t` opens it for editing in Think. Only F2 sends. No unmet conditions means observe
  the accepted behavior, not invent another feature. See [Taste](docs/design/taste.md).
- **Measure:** `r` explicitly reads this repo's PRs updated in the last 30 days from
  GitHub through `gh`. Lists all states; Enter shows dates, author, URL and reported
  PR-head checks. No metrics or acceptance claims. See [Measure](docs/design/menu.md#measure).
- **Light or dark:** Ctrl-T or the `dark` label beside `?` switches every screen to warm
  charcoal until you quit; each launch starts light. See [principles](docs/design/principles.md#visual-meaning).

On first default-root launch, old saved sessions move once to Tinkery's sessions folder,
with a visible notice and no Think-record writes. History matches unique ledger session IDs. Leftover old and new roots
refuse rather than merge; no old-root reader remains. Runs bound to moved seeds show unknown
in Watch, not a guessed match.

The complete journey and its benefit remain unproven; passing checks are not acceptance.

## Where we’re going next

Measure lists PRs, not accepted outcomes or recorded effort. The broader measurement
proposals are closed, not planned. See the
[first-release plan](docs/design/first-release.md) and [task index](docs/design/first-release-issues.md).
Published issues own proposal scope; publication is not implementation permission.

## What success means

**Useful, verified changes per hour of your attention**, not more agents or code.
Active effort is not elapsed time; passing checks is not your acceptance. Unknown
evidence stays unknown. Improvement needs a separately permitted baseline and trial;
it is not a measured claim.

## Try it

Fresh Debian or Ubuntu clone:

```bash
./scripts/cloud-setup.sh
export PATH="${CARGO_HOME:-$HOME/.cargo}/bin:$PWD/.cloud-tools/node/bin:$PATH"
cargo +stable run --locked -- --home
```

Think is practice: no model calls or saved goals. Tend writes needs only when you
explicitly link or unlink. F2 sends, Enter adds a line, F1 lists what else you can do, Esc returns to the menu.
Add `--snapshot` for text output.

Real drafting requires `--shape-pi --model provider/model-id` and an
explicitly authorized budget; provider charges may apply. `--help` lists options.
[Terminal setup](docs/terminal-setup.md#launch) gives an isolated trial.
