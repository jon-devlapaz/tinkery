# Watch

Watch shows the runs in one tink-sdlc checkout, read-only, and puts the runs waiting on a
person first. It is a view, not a touch: it decides nothing, starts nothing and changes nothing.

## Source

The operator names the checkout with `--sdlc-root PATH`. Watch never discovers or scans for
checkouts: tink-sdlc's guide says opening a checkout trusts its executable code, so only an
explicitly named one is read. Without a root, Watch says how to name one and runs nothing. A
root without `_system/scripts/sdlc.py` is refused by a file check, without running anything.

Watch reads with that checkout's own `python3 _system/scripts/sdlc.py status --json`, from the
checkout's folder, when Watch opens and when the operator presses `r`. It then reads each valid
run's `status <slug> --json`, serially, before offering the list (except older runs below): the summary cannot identify owed
attestations or gates during a running verification. An unreadable detail refuses the list rather
than claiming that run is quiet. Enter reads the selected run's detail again. The screen names the checkout and the exact command behind what it
shows, with how long ago it was read, to the minute. Watch never runs `verify`, `mark`, `decide`,
`stage` or any other command, and never polls, refreshes by itself, notifies or badges anything:
unchanged state makes no new demand on the operator's attention.

## Reading

Each read runs off the paint path with a 30-second deadline, at most 4 MiB of output and its
own process group. Leaving Watch, or closing a run's detail, stops and reaps the read; a late
result is never shown. A refused read shows tink-sdlc's own `error.message`.

The shared `sdlc` boundary owns the bounded status process and envelope validation;
Watch owns attention and presentation. Parsing and original-seed reads run on the
worker, never during painting or input. The [SDLC handoff](shape-and-handoff.md#sdlc-handoff)
owns matching and keeps three states distinct:
- A matched seed supplies the exact saved goal.
- An explicit null record means no confirmed seed was used, not a failed match.
  Show nothing in the list; detail says `No confirmed seed was recorded for this run.`
- An edited, moved, missing or unreadable original, or a missing/malformed record,
  says `Goal unknown: the original seed changed or can't be found.` in needs-you
  rows and detail. Never borrow a goal from the run name or another original.

Watch reads only tink-sdlc API 1: `protocol` must be `tink-sdlc` and `api_version` the integer 1.
Any other interface, an unknown `verification_status` or gate state, or a run missing a field
fails the whole read closed, with what was wrong, rather than display a guess.

An API 1 invalid summary whose exact reason is the canonical-run-ID requirement is
an `older run`, not `can't be read`. Show `This run has no canonical run ID. Its approvals
and verification can't be checked here.` under Needs you; never infer stale approval or
verified work. Its detail uses that summary, names the same gap and offers Esc, without
requesting the unsupported per-run status or inventing gates and checklist counts.
`r` from this detail rereads the summary and returns to the list. Other invalid reasons
stay invalid. Watch neither migrates nor edits run files; tink-sdlc is unchanged.
An agent saying it is done is never evidence; Watch shows only what tink-sdlc computes.

## Needs you first

A run needs a person when tink-sdlc reports it:

| `verification_status` | Shown as | Why it needs a person |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blocked` | waiting on a decision | tink-sdlc reports `blocked` only while a gate isn't approved |
| `failed` | verification failed | someone has to look at the failure |
| `interrupted` | verification interrupted | the last pass didn't finish |
| `invalid` | can't be read | the run is broken; its reason is shown |

These lead, as do runs whose detail has any unapproved gate, an owed manual attestation, or an
attestation flagged `needs_recheck`. A non-automatic item whose `status` is not `passed` is owed,
except provisional (`pending: true`) items awaiting activation. A passed attestation with
`needs_recheck` is shown as **may need recheck**, not declared invalid: upstream says to recheck
only if the change affects it. Automatic pending checks alone do not demand a person.

This interpretation follows API 1's `checklist_view` and `status_state` in
[tink-sdlc at 1c6ffd59](https://github.com/jon-devlapaz/tink-sdlc/blob/1c6ffd59902a742a2b3bb607ab75c41dc2e95e55/assets/_system/scripts/sdlc.py).
Watch requires the typed `automatic`, `proof`, `status`, `needs_recheck` and `mark` fields;
missing or unfamiliar fields are not quiet. Each group keeps tink-sdlc's order. Needs-you rows
retain tink-sdlc's `next_action` (or the invalid run's reason). Under them, show
only the goal's first line verbatim, or its unknown line, indented four spaces in ink.
A known no-seed run adds nothing. Quiet runs stay exactly one clipped line, without
a goal or seed-status sub-line. Selected-row scrolling accounts for wrapped needs-you
sub-lines and keeps the selected run visible.

A run's detail keeps the full matched goal, wrapped and untrimmed, escaping unsafe
controls only for display. Its state, next action, gates, checklist counts, individual
expectations and recorded evidence follow, plus tink-sdlc's errors. The checklist
summary separates passed results from checking methods: `Checklist: 0/4 passed.
How each is checked: 0 automated, 4 by you.` describes how checks are done,
not how many attestations have been given. Individual
items retain their reported status, including `pending (attested)`.
↑↓, PgUp/PgDn and Home/End scroll wrapped content,
including long evidence and error tails. Opening or rereading detail resets to the top. One run
at a time; Esc returns to the list. F10 returns to Home from Watch, including help,
without quitting Tinkery. Scrolling launches nothing.

## Verification

Unit tests in `src/watch/tests.rs` cover the ordering (a waiting run never sorts below a quiet
one), interface and state refusals, detail counts, the deadline, leaving mid-read (the process
is gone afterwards) and that opening and reading again leave the checkout byte-identical.
The fake reader atomically publishes its PID only after writing it; file creation alone is not
readiness. A regression holds the write open to prove cancellation cannot observe an empty PID.
This keeps process-lifetime mechanics behind the shared reader (architecture diagnostics 3 and 6);
no production interface or cancellation policy changes.
[The terminal journey](../../tests/watch_terminal.py) drives the real binary over a fake
`sdlc.py` at 100x30, 80x24 and with NO_COLOR, including owed-attestation ordering after successful
verification, every verification state, scrolling to long evidence/error tails, and
matched, edited, moved and missing originals, no-seed runs, one-line quiet rows and
older runs missing canonical IDs, summary refresh and no unsupported detail calls or file changes.
Unit tests cover all three goal states in list/detail, exact first-line indentation,
full detail words, wide quiet rows and selected-row scrolling. Stubs prove
mechanics, not operator dogfood.

The three-way goal reading and compact list/detail split improve architecture diagnostics
2 and 6: absence cannot masquerade as a failed match, and display rules stay behind
Watch's existing interface. No cross-phase imports or relaxed limits are introduced.
