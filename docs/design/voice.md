# Local voice

## Ownership and consent

Tinkery owns its voice engine, settings and install. It does **not** read Pi Voice,
Pi settings or agent directories and has no Pi fallback.

`voice/setup.mjs` owns discovery/install paths and settings. Engine dependencies
are pinned to `transcribe-cpp@0.2.2` and `@picovoice/pvrecorder-node@1.2.9` in the
Tinkery user-data voice directory. The install records its Node major; a mismatch
asks for reinstall rather than loading incompatible native addons. Node resolution
is `TINKERY_NODE`, then PATH, then the login shell; explicit overrides are authoritative.

Model resolution uses the explicit `TINKERY_VOICE_MODEL` override, optional Tinkery
voice config, or the newest matching Parakeet Q8 GGUF snapshot in the shared
Hugging Face cache. Config defaults are system microphone and English. A missing
engine or model gets one quiet consent line with download size; nothing downloads
silently. Declining suppresses further prompting for that visit/session lifecycle.
The key remains discoverable even before setup. Cloud setup installs **none** of
these native engine/model packages.

## Take lifecycle

The Rust `VoiceHost` boundary keeps process handling out of think. The embedded
setup/helper source runs via Node ESM `--eval`, not a runtime helper file.
Commands/events are versioned JSON lines with take IDs so stale callbacks cannot
modify a newer take. The helper stays goal-blind.

- macOS advertises `⌃⌥Z speak`; elsewhere `F6 speak`. F6 and Ctrl+Alt+Z work
  everywhere. The macOS Ω variant inserts no character and never undoes a skip.
- Only explicit start records. Partial text is muted **at the current cursor**;
  final text inserts at the cursor when it arrives. There is no tracked old anchor.
- Text stays editable and never auto-sends. F2 during a take stops first, waits
  for final (30-second deadline), then sends exactly once.
- Esc cancels/discards the take. Leaving think, stdin EOF and Drop stop/release
  the recorder and terminate the helper. Voice is disabled in review/receipt.
- A recorder read rejected by deliberate stop ends the take; it is not an audio
  failure. Permission, unavailable/busy microphone, install/model/version and
  engine errors get one actionable plain line. Near-zero capture and known
  silence fillers insert nothing (“Didn't catch that.”).

No audio is retained and no transcript is logged. Local voice does not send
anything to a provider; F2 in **live shaping mode** sends the editable text like
any other submitted answer, under that mode's explicit budget.

## Tests, not microphone access

Fake hosts cover keys, inserts, races, finalization, errors and cleanup. Node tests
inject fake engines/recorders and synthetic PCM, with no native addons or network.
PTYs work with `TINKERY_NODE=/tinkery-TEST-no-node` and temporary homes. Never record
real audio to validate a change. Native generated-WAV smoke tests require separate
operator approval and are not in the documented zero-call suite. Preserve the
stop-rejected-read reversion probe.
