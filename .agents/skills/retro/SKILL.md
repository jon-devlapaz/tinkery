Suggest environment improvements for future agent runs; present candidates, not
unrequested changes. Tinkery's rules live in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) and
`docs/design/`, not a separate standards file or reviewer agent.

## Steps

1. Read [writing-for-agents](../writing-for-agents/SKILL.md).
2. Read primary sources for the specified session, including local logs when needed;
   default to this session.
3. Find improvements using the checks below.
4. Present candidates in severity order.

## Checks

- **Navigation:** if discovery was slow or dependencies hidden, identify a missing pointer.
- **Automation:** read existing check commands and CI first. An unwired or broken check is
  the finding, not a reason to reinvent it. If neither a hook nor CI runs lint, types or tests,
  that is itself a gap. Mechanical violations (syntax, banned APIs, imports, file locations)
  require deterministic checks in the cheapest existing linter, hook or CI boundary,
  not prose rules. Reserve review guidance for genuine judgment calls.
- **Context:** review large project and global steering files for rules better enforced
  by automation or consulted during review. Delete no-ops; disclose task-specific detail.
- **Corrections:** for each operator correction, name the layer that holds its fix now
  and propose the leftmost one, per Yohaku's [move each correction left](../../../docs/yohaku.md#for-anyone-changing-tinkery-human-or-agent).
  Count corrections apart from required decisions (confirm, approve, merge): a fix may
  remove a correction, never a decision.
- **Tool economy:** identify expensive, repetitive or token-heavy calls, CLIs and MCP tools.
- **Access:** identify missing evidence sources, such as captured server logs or read-only
  service access; access changes still require permission.

## Reference

Implementation carries context from exploration and debugging; review starts from a diff.
Put judgment-oriented standards in review, keeping implementation's always-loaded
`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` sparse and pointer-led. Prefer existing docs for reference;
add navigation if a standards file exceeds 1,000 lines. Use skills for discoverable
reference or user-invoked commands, following writing-for-agents invocation guidance.
